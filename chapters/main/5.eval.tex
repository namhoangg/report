\chapter{Conclusion, Evaluation, and Future Development Directions}
\section{Conclusion}
Throughout this initial phase, under the dedicated guidance of Dr. Nguyen Thi Ai Thao and MSc. Tran Thi Que Nguyet, our team has successfully accomplished the fundamental objectives of our project: "Building a System for Enterprises to Introduce Services and Quotation in the Field of Transportation and Freight Forwarding." During this phase, we have completed the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conducted comprehensive research on transport and freight forwarding management systems, including detailed studies of services, pricing structures, and quotation systems in the industry
    \item Investigated and analyzed various tools and open-source solutions for landing page development
    \item Acquired proficiency in relevant programming languages, explored open-source technologies, studied virtual assistants based on large language models, and examined related third-party integrations
    \item Performed thorough system analysis and design, identified key challenges, and developed appropriate algorithmic solutions
    \item Successfully implemented a demonstration of core features
\end{itemize}
\section{Evaluation}
The completion of this project phase has provided us with invaluable insights into the logistics industry, particularly in freight forwarding operations. We have significantly expanded our technical knowledge base through exposure to new technologies and programming languages, which will prove beneficial not only for the next project phase but also for our future professional careers.

However, we encountered several challenges during the project implementation. Notable among these was our initial lack of proactiveness in the early stages and the difficulty in comprehending an unfamiliar industry domain. These challenges have provided important learning opportunities for improvement.

Through careful reflection, we have identified several areas for enhancement in future work:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Increasing proactive engagement with industry experts and experienced professionals
    \item Implementing more effective time management strategies
    \item Developing more structured approaches to learning new domain knowledge
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Development Directions}
\subsection{Implementation Timeline and Resource Allocation}
In the next phase of the project (Capstone), we will follow a structured Agile methodology with our dedicated team of two developers. Each team member will commit at least 4 hours per day, 5 days a week, resulting in a combined weekly capacity of 40 team hours. This systematic approach will ensure efficient resource utilization and enable iterative development of project features through clearly defined sprints and milestones.

\subsubsection{Team Composition and Work Structure}
The development team consisted of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hoang Dai Nam}: Specialized in frontend development, UI/UX implementation, and client-side integration
    \item \textbf{Vu Minh Quan}: Focused on backend development, database management, and system architecture
\end{itemize}

The work structure was organized into 8 sprints spanning 15 weeks, with each sprint carefully planned to maximize productivity and ensure steady progress toward project objectives.

\subsubsection{Agile Methodology Implementation}
The project utilized core Agile practices to ensure efficient development and continuous improvement:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Daily Stand-ups: 15-minute daily meetings for progress updates and blocker identification
    \item Sprint Planning: Bi-weekly 2-hour sessions for detailed task planning
    \item Sprint Reviews: 1-hour sessions at sprint conclusion for demonstration and feedback
    \item Sprint Retrospectives: 1-hour sessions for process improvement discussions
    \item Continuous Integration/Deployment: Automated testing and deployment throughout development
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Resource Utilization Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total Project Duration: 15 weeks
    \item Total Resource Allocation: 600 man-hours
    \item Individual Contribution: 300 hours per developer
    \item Daily Development Time: 4 hours per person
    \item Weekly Team Capacity: 40 hours
\end{itemize}

This structured approach to project implementation enabled efficient progress tracking, clear task ownership, and effective resource management throughout the development cycle.
