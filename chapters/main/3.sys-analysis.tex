\end{itemize}

By addressing these limitations, FreightFlex aims to provide a comprehensive solution that enhances operational efficiency, improves customer experience, and enables freight forwarding companies to maintain competitiveness in an increasingly digital marketplace.
\section{Introduction to the System}
FreightFlex is a web-based system that helps freight forwarding companies manage their business online. The system uses a multi-tenant approach, which means multiple companies can use the same platform while keeping their data completely separate from each other.

When a freight forwarding company subscribes to FreightFlex, they receive their own workspace with a unique web address. This workspace acts as their digital office where they can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create their company website landing page
    \item Display their shipping services
    \item Provide automatic price quotes to customers
    \item Perform all essential operations typical of a freight forwarding application
\end{itemize}
