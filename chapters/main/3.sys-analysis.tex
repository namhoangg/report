\section{Introduction to the System}
FreightFlex is a web-based system that helps freight forwarding companies manage their business online. The system uses a multi-tenant approach, which means multiple companies can use the same platform while keeping their data completely separate from each other.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create their company website landing page
